# Understanding the problem

Every great design starts with a deep understanding of the problem we're trying to solve. I spend significant time in this phase, conducting user research, analyzing data, and empathizing with the people who will ultimately use what I'm designing.

## Research and discovery

My process begins with thorough research. This includes user interviews, competitive analysis, and stakeholder discussions. I believe that the best solutions come from truly understanding the context and constraints we're working within.

## Ideation and exploration

Once I have a solid foundation of understanding, I move into the ideation phase. This is where creativity meets strategy. I explore multiple solutions, often starting with rapid sketches and low-fidelity prototypes.

## Prototyping and testing

Ideas are only as good as their execution. I create interactive prototypes to test concepts with real users, gathering feedback and iterating based on their responses. This cycle of build-test-learn is at the heart of my process.

## Refinement and delivery

The final phase involves refining the design based on testing insights, creating detailed specifications, and working closely with development teams to ensure the vision is realized effectively.

This process isn't always linearâ€”design thinking is iterative by nature, and I often find myself cycling back through earlier phases as new insights emerge.
